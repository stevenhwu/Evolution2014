===== Useful alias/variables =====
$MapRoomToIP		store room and IP info
$evoServerName		server name, either evo-primary OR evo-secondary

sshRoom roomNumber	ssh into a presentation room. roomNumber have to exist in $MapRoomToIP
sshPrimary		ssh into evo-primary server
sshSecondary		ssh inot evo-secondary server

===== Usage =====
There are several scripts to ensure all presentations are synced properly. The most useful one are the follow.

runAll: Sync presentations from XCD, preprocess them locally, then rsync to each room.
	usage:
	./runAll
 

runPushToRoom: Sync presentations to presentation room(s).
	 - Without any parameters, this scripts will sync all presentations to each room for that given day only.
	 - First parameter which is the room number (e.g. 301A). Then this scripts will only sync the presentations for that room.
	   Also take "ALL" or "all", which will sync to all rooms.
	 - Second parameter, which is the date (20,21,22,23,24) or dateCode (0,1,2,3,4). This allow us to sync presentations for the following day.

	usage:
	./runPushToRoom		# Sync presentations to ALL rooms for "today" ONLY
	./runPushToRoom ALL	# Same as above
	./runPushToRoom all	# Same as above
	./runPushToRoom 301A	# Sync presentations to room 301A ONLY and for "today" ONLY
	./runPushToRoom 301A 2	# Sync presentations to room 301A ONLY and for 22/Sunday ONLY
	./runPushToRoom 301A 22	# Sync presentations to room 301A ONLY and for 22/Sunday ONLY
	./runPushToRoom ALL 22 # Sync presentations to ALL rooms and for 22/Sunday ONLY

	Invalid usage:
	./runPushToRoom 301A 301B	# Error, two room numbers
	./runPushToRoom 22		# Error, got date but no room number

runManualUpload: setup symbolic links after a file is manually uploaded
	- All manual uploaded files should be in the /home/sw167/Desktop/Evo14LocalMirror/ManualUpload/ folder
	- For standard presentation, rename it to standard format. PresentationFile_ID.*
	- Create a folder with AbstractID, and put movies in there without renaming it
	- Files in the folder have high priority than files in the Cache folder (the symbolic link will points toward ManualUpload folder)
	- This file is automatically executed within PrecessLocalCache

	usage:
	./runManualupload

runSyncXCD: Sync presentations from XCD and preprocess them locally. This one runs frequently in crontab. Shouldn't need to run this manually.
	usage:
	./runSyncXCD



===== Folder structure =====
Local primary/secondary servers:

~/Evolution2014		This folders contain all the scripts and other setup file. This is also on github

~/Desktop/Evo14LocalMirror/		Local Mirror
~/Desktop/Evo14LocalMirror/Log		All log files from crontab
~/Desktop/Evo14LocalMirror/Cache	Presentation synced from XCD
~/Desktop/Evo14LocalMirror/ManualUpload	Files uploaded from the evo-primary/secondary server, NOT on XCD
~/Desktop/Evo14LocalMirror/RoomInfo	Store room-IP info from each presentation laptop

201 – 402,BalC		Presentation room. Each room should only have the symbolic link which points to the presentations.
