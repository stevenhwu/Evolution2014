There are several scripts to ensure all presentations are synced properly. The most useful one are the follow.

runAll: Sync presentations from XCD, preprocess them locally, then rsync to each room.

runPushToRoom:Sync presentations to presentation room(s).
 - Without any parameters, this scripts will sync all presentations to each room.
 - Take 1 parameter which is the room number (e.g. 301A). Then this scripts will only sync the presentations for that room.

runSyncXCD: Sync presentations from XCD and preprocess them locally. This one runs frequently in crontab. Shouldn't need to run this manually.

===================================
Variables: Update required at RCC

variablesEvoServer: Store the IPs for primary and secondary server
variablesMapping: Store the IPs and room number for all the presentation laptops.



===================================
Folder structure
Local server:
~/Evolution2014
This folders contain all the scripts and other setup file. This is also on github

~/Desktop/Evo14LocalMirror/		Local Server
~/Desktop/Evo14LocalMirror/Log		All log files from crontab
~/Desktop/Evo14LocalMirror/Cache		Presentation downloaded from XCD
~/Desktop/Evo14LocalMirror/RoomInfo	Store room-IP info from each presentation laptop

201 – 402,BalC		Presentation room. Each room should only have the symbolic link which points to the presentations for that day only.
